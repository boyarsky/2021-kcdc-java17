This repository includes the code samples used in my KCDC Java 17 presentation along with the lab solutions. The lab assignment is as follows.

# Module 1

1. Use a text block to print a tic tac toe grid that looks something like this:
```
-------------------------------
|         |         |         |
-------------------------------
|         |         |         |
-------------------------------
|         |         |         |
-------------------------------
```
2. Add a title to the beginning of your text block that includes quotes. For example "My board"
3. Add a description to the end of your text block that includes \ and \s and essential whitespace
4. Add incidental whitespace to your text block if it isn't already there
5. Explore using strip(), stripIndent(), stripLeading() and stripTrailing() on your code
6. Look at the solution of a neighbor to see what your code has in common/different. (Yes, I'm asking you to actually talk to another human being.)
